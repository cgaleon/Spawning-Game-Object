//couple notes: 

//1. Create a game object that will be spawned and make it a prefab. Then, delete it from the hierarchy tab. 
//2. Create an empty game object called "Spawner" in the hierarchy. Place the spawner in the location of where you want the game object to spawn. 
//3. Attach this script to the spawner 
//4. Finally, add the prefab game object into the script in Unity.
